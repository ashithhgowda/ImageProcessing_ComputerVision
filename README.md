# ImageProcessing_ComputerVision
This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV and NumPy. It includes fundamental operations such as image resizing, rotation, flipping, edge detection, thresholding, morphological transformations, and drawing shapes. The processed images are displayed using Matplotlib.  

## Features  
- Grayscale Conversion  
- Image Resizing & Rotation  
- Flipping (Horizontal)  
- Blurring & Edge Detection (Canny, Sobel, Laplacian)  
- Thresholding (Binary & Adaptive)  
- Morphological Transformations (Dilation, Erosion, Gradient)  
- Color Space Conversions (HSV, LAB)  
- Histogram Equalization  
- Drawing Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, Line)  

## Dependencies  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy (`numpy`)  
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)  

## Usage  
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:  
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib;

## Run the script:
bash
python image_processing.py;

Replace "dog.jpg" with your own image file to test.

Output
The script processes the image and displays multiple transformations using Matplotlib.
